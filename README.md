AppCondo is a digital store for applications' search and download. I used Webpacker and Justin Gordon's React-on-Rails library which integrates Rails(server side) with React framework(frontend). The Search bar is a react component which dynamically fetches and renders search results from a new JSON endpoint on the rails app. For the styling, I used Semantic UI.
